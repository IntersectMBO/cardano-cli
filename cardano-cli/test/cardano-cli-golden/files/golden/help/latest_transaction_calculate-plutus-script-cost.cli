  Calculate the costs of the Plutus scripts of a given transaction.

Available options:
  --start-time-utc UTC-TIME
                           The genesis start time in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
                           format.
  --start-time-posix POSIX-TIME
                           The genesis start time as POSIX seconds.
  --genesis-file FILEPATH  Path to the Byron genesis file from which to get the
                           start time.
  --unsafe-extend-safe-zone
                           Allow overriding the validity of the era history past
                           the safe zone. The safe zone is a period of time
                           during which we are sure there won't be any era
                           transition (hard fork), and we are confident that the
                           slot duration will not change, thus the conversion
                           from slot numbers to POSIX times using the era
                           history will be correct. This safe zone is
                           conservative. Even if we are past the safe zone, if
                           there hasn't been any era transition (hard fork)
                           since we obtained it, we can continue safely using
                           the era history. This flag essentially disables the
                           safe zone check. This allows the user to use the era
                           history past the safe zone, at the user's discretion.
  --era-history-file FILEPATH
                           Filepath of the era history file as produced by the
                           'query era-history' command. The era history contains
                           information about when era transitions happened and
                           can be used together with the start time to convert
                           slot numbers to POSIX times.
  --utxo-file FILEPATH     Filepath to a JSON-encoded UTxO file as produced by
                           the 'query utxo' command. Only UTxOs referenced by
                           the transaction are needed, not the whole UTxO, but
                           unnecessary info will be ignored.
  --protocol-params-file FILEPATH
                           Filepath of the JSON-encoded protocol parameters file
  --cardano-mode           For talking to a node running in full Cardano mode
                           (default).
  --epoch-slots SLOTS      The number of slots per epoch for the Byron era.
                           (default: 21600)
  --mainnet                Use the mainnet magic id. This overrides the
                           CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID environment variable
  --testnet-magic NATURAL  Specify a testnet magic id. This overrides the
                           CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID environment variable
  --socket-path SOCKET_PATH
                           Path to the node socket. This overrides the
                           CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH environment variable. The
                           argument is optional if CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH is
                           defined and mandatory otherwise.
  --tx-file FILEPATH       Filepath of the transaction whose Plutus scripts to
                           calculate the cost.
  --out-file FILEPATH      The output file.
