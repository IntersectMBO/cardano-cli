  Node query commands. Will query the local node whose Unix domain socket is
  obtained from the CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH environment variable.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Available commands:
  protocol-parameters      Get the node's current protocol parameters
  tip                      Get the node's current tip (slot no, hash, block no)
  stake-pools              Get the node's current set of stake pool ids
  stake-distribution       Get the node's current aggregated stake distribution
  stake-address-info       Get the current delegations and reward accounts
                           filtered by stake address.
  era-history              Obtains the era history data. The era history
                           contains information about when era transitions
                           happened and can be used together with the start time
                           to convert slot numbers to POSIX times offline
                           (without connecting to the node). Converting slot
                           numbers to POSIX times is useful, for example, when
                           calculating the cost of executing a Plutus script.
                           And being able to do it offline means that it can be
                           calculated without access to a live node.
  utxo                     Get a portion of the current UTxO: by tx in, by
                           address or the whole.
  ledger-state             Dump the current ledger state of the node
                           (Ledger.NewEpochState -- advanced command)
  protocol-state           Dump the current protocol state of the node
                           (Ledger.ChainDepState -- advanced command)
  stake-snapshot           Obtain the three stake snapshots for a pool, plus the
                           total active stake (advanced command)
  pool-params              DEPRECATED. Use query pool-state instead. Dump the
                           pool parameters
                           (Ledger.NewEpochState.esLState._delegationState._pState._pParams
                           -- advanced command)
  leadership-schedule      Get the slots the node is expected to mint a block in
                           (advanced command)
  kes-period-info          Get information about the current KES period and your
                           node's operational certificate.
  pool-state               Dump the pool state
  tx-mempool               Local Mempool info
  slot-number              Query slot number for UTC timestamp
  ledger-peer-snapshot     Dump the current snapshot of big ledger peers. These
                           are the largest pools that cumulatively hold 90% of
                           total stake.
