  Calculate the costs of the Plutus scripts of a given transaction.

Available options:
  --start-time-utc UTC-TIME
                           The genesis start time in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
                           format.
  --start-time-posix POSIX-TIME
                           The genesis start time as POSIX seconds.
  --unsafe-extend-safe-zone
                           Allow extending the validity of the era history past
                           the safe zone. The safe zone is a period of time
                           during which we are sure there won't be any era
                           transition (hard fork), and we have confidence that
                           the conversion from slot numbers to POSIX times using
                           the era history will be correct. This safe zone is
                           conservative, and if the user knows that a hard fork
                           hasn't happened since the era history was obtained,
                           it is safe for it to be used past the safe zone by
                           using this flag.
  --era-history-file FILEPATH
                           Filepath of the era history file as produced by the
                           'query era-history' command. The era history contains
                           information about when era transitions happened and
                           can be used together with the start time to convert
                           slot numbers to POSIX times.
  --utxo-file FILEPATH     Filepath of the JSON-encoded file with info about the
                           set of relevant UTxOs in the format produced by the
                           'query utxo' command.
  --protocol-params-file FILEPATH
                           Filepath of the JSON-encoded protocol parameters file
  --cardano-mode           For talking to a node running in full Cardano mode
                           (default).
  --epoch-slots SLOTS      The number of slots per epoch for the Byron era.
                           (default: 21600)
  --mainnet                Use the mainnet magic id. This overrides the
                           CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID environment variable
  --testnet-magic NATURAL  Specify a testnet magic id. This overrides the
                           CARDANO_NODE_NETWORK_ID environment variable
  --socket-path SOCKET_PATH
                           Path to the node socket. This overrides the
                           CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH environment variable. The
                           argument is optional if CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH is
                           defined and mandatory otherwise.
  --tx-file FILEPATH       Filepath of the transaction whose Plutus scripts to
                           calculate the cost.
  --out-file FILEPATH      The output file.
