  Node query commands. Will query the local node whose Unix domain socket is
  obtained from the CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH environment variable.

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Available commands:
  committee-state          Get the committee state
  constitution             Get the constitution
  drep-state               Get the DRep state.
  drep-stake-distribution  Get the DRep stake distribution.
  era-history              Obtains the era history data. The era history
                           contains information about when era transitions
                           happened and can be used together with the start time
                           to convert slot numbers to POSIX times offline
                           (without connecting to the node). Converting slot
                           numbers to POSIX times is useful, for example, when
                           calculating the cost of executing a Plutus script.
                           And being able to do it offline means that it can be
                           calculated without access to a live node.
  future-pparams           Get the protocol parameters that will apply at the
                           next epoch
  gov-state                Get the governance state
  kes-period-info          Get information about the current KES period and your
                           node's operational certificate.
  leadership-schedule      Get the slots the node is expected to mint a block in
                           (advanced command)
  ledger-peer-snapshot     Dump the current snapshot of ledger peers.These are
                           the largest pools that cumulatively hold 90% of total
                           stake.
  ledger-state             Dump the current ledger state of the node
                           (Ledger.NewEpochState -- advanced command)
  pool-params              DEPRECATED. Use query pool-state instead. Dump the
                           pool parameters
                           (Ledger.NewEpochState.esLState._delegationState._pState._pParams
                           -- advanced command)
  pool-state               Dump the pool state
  proposals                Get the governance proposals that are eligible for
                           ratification. Proposals submitted during the current
                           epoch are excluded, as they cannot be ratified until
                           the next epoch.
  protocol-parameters      Get the node's current protocol parameters
  protocol-state           Dump the current protocol state of the node
                           (Ledger.ChainDepState -- advanced command)
  ratify-state             Get the ratification state
  ref-script-size          Calculate the reference input scripts size in bytes
                           for provided transaction inputs.
  slot-number              Query slot number for UTC timestamp
  spo-stake-distribution   Get the SPO stake distribution.
  stake-address-info       Get the current delegations and reward accounts
                           filtered by stake address.
  stake-distribution       Get the node's current aggregated stake distribution
  stake-pools              Get the node's current set of stake pool ids
  stake-pool-default-vote  Get the stake pool default vote.
  stake-snapshot           Obtain the three stake snapshots for a pool, plus the
                           total active stake (advanced command)

  tx-mempool               Local Mempool info
  utxo                     Get a portion of the current UTxO: by tx in, by
                           address or the whole.
