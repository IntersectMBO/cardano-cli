Available commands:
  verification-key         Get a verification key from a signing key. This
                           supports all key types.
  non-extended-key         Get a non-extended verification key from an extended
                           verification key. This supports all extended key
                           types.
  generate-mnemonic        Generate a mnemonic sentence that can be used for key
                           derivation.
  derive-from-mnemonic     Derive an extended signing key from a mnemonic
                           sentence. To ensure the safety of the mnemonic
                           phrase, we recommend that key derivation is performed
                           in an air-gapped environment.
  convert-byron-key        Convert a Byron payment, genesis or genesis delegate
                           key (signing or verification) to a corresponding
                           Shelley-format key.
  convert-byron-genesis-vkey
                           Convert a Base64-encoded Byron genesis verification
                           key to a Shelley genesis verification key
  convert-itn-key          Convert an Incentivized Testnet (ITN) non-extended
                           (Ed25519) signing or verification key to a
                           corresponding Shelley stake key
  convert-itn-extended-key Convert an Incentivized Testnet (ITN) extended
                           (Ed25519Extended) signing key to a corresponding
                           Shelley stake signing key
  convert-itn-bip32-key    Convert an Incentivized Testnet (ITN) BIP32
                           (Ed25519Bip32) signing key to a corresponding Shelley
                           stake signing key
  convert-cardano-address-key
                           Convert a cardano-address extended signing key to a
                           corresponding Shelley-format key.
