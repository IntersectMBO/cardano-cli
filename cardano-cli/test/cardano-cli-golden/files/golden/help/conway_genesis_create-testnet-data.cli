  Create data to use for starting a testnet.

Available options:
  --spec-shelley FILE      The shelley specification file to use as input. A
                           default one is generated if omitted.
  --spec-alonzo FILE       The alonzo specification file to use as input. A
                           default one is generated if omitted.
  --spec-conway FILE       The conway specification file to use as input. A
                           default one is generated if omitted.
  --genesis-keys INT       The number of genesis keys to make (default is 3).
  --pools INT              The number of stake pool credential sets to make
                           (default is 0).
  --stake-delegators INT   The number of stake delegator credential sets to make
                           (default is 0). Credentials are written to disk.
  --transient-stake-delegators INT
                           The number of stake delegator credential sets to make
                           (default is 0). The credentials are NOT written to
                           disk.
  --drep-keys INT          The number of DRep credentials to make (default is

  --utxo-keys INT          The number of UTxO keys to make (default is 0).
  --total-supply LOVELACE  The maximum possible amount of Lovelace, which is
                           evenly distributed across stake holders. Overrides
                           the value from the shelley genesis. If
                           --delegated-supply is specified, a part of this
                           amount will be delegated.
  --delegated-supply LOVELACE
                           The amount of the total supply which is evenly
                           delegated. Defaulted to half of the total supply.
