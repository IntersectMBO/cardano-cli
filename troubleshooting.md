## Troubleshooting

### 1. "cardano-cli: Network.Socket.connect: <socket>: does not exist"
Ensure `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH` is set correctly and the node is running.

### 2. Error: ./checkpoints.json: withBinaryFile: does not exist
Ensure you have the latest [configuration](https://book.world.dev.cardano.org/environments.html) files based on your network.
