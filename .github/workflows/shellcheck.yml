# This pipeline runs shellcheck on all files with extension .sh,
# except the ones listed in .github/workflows/shellcheck-exceptions.txt.
#
# This pipeline uses Nix, so that the shellcheck version used is the same
# ones as used by developers in Nix shells. This ensures the CI's behavior
# is consistent with the one of developers.
