> **_NOTE:_**  Ideally, we should merge only fully implemented and tested features into the master branch. 
> So all the above steps are required for the PR to be merged.  
> In order to avoid the PRs becoming stale and requiring to be rebased on master, these can be merged 
> after a reasonable time (current agreement is 3 days) if the System Test Engineer Owner's sign-off 
> was not provided (last step in the DoD).

> **_IMPORTANT:_** Any deviation from the plan should be discussed and agreed as a comment in the Feature file.
